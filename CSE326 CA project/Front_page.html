                <h6>Current situation of students in India</h6>
                <p> It is about 4 months that the students are not going to schools, colleges or any other study centres. Due to COVID -19 students and even parents don’t have mental peace. As so many things are in pause like schools, colleges, institutions,
                    companies, sports, shopping malls, service centres, cinema’s etc. to maintain social distances and it is very clear that children’s and elders are in a risky position, therefore government decided to shut down all the public places
                    including schools, colleges and other institutions.
                    <span id="dott">.......</span><span id="more"> While going to schools and colleges so many things were in proper form like their daily schedule is all set, their study timings, playing time, lunchtime etc. since the lockdown students are in a big loss, the loss is not only in academics but also their physic. When students went to their schools and colleges they interact with their friends and teachers discuss their problems and learn new things.The atmosphere in schools and colleges is very different as compared to home. Parents are trying their best to cooperate with their children’s in online studies and other things.Some schools are providing online classes through some apps and also conduct meetings with parents and students.Many schools have created class wise WhatsApp groups to send videos related to their studies but still, there is a huge gap between classroom studies and online studies. In rural areas, online studies are not possible due to the lack of facilities.   </span>
